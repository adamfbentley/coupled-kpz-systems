# COUPLED KARDAR-PARISI-ZHANG EQUATION: DISCOVERY OF NOVEL UNIVERSALITY CLASSES

## ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of **novel universality classes** in coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) 
growth processes through large-scale computational analysis. Our results demonstrate that 
cross-interface coupling fundamentally alters the scaling behavior, leading to growth exponents 
significantly different from the standard KPZ value β = 1/3.
